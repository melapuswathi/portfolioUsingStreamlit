# portfolioUsingStreamlit
A small project using Streamlit. This is my first time using it. So, first timers can go through the commented code to understand how things work.
I used to develop web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Going forward with React JS. Keeping that aside. Python is also said to be a scripting language. So, ever wondered how to integrate HTML and Python instead of Javascript? Well, this can be achieved through a Python library "eel". There is another library that actually doesn't need any HTML or CSS but just Python. Excited?
That is the Streamlit library. You just need to code it in python and it will do the HTML, and CSS for you in the background. I just got to know this a few days ago and wanted to share this with you. So, Out of excitement just built this small page on it.
